# transcriptionGUI

This is supposed to be a simple GUI written in python to access ai transcription models. I found that local transcription models such as those found in smartphones arenÂ´t sufficiently acurate, and most apps or websites require a monthly subscription well in excess of what one would pay directly to the ai providers for transcribing a resoanable ammount of audio. As such, just to make things more practical than using CURL, I made this small python app. Fell free to contribute.
